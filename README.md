# SKYGRAM
  Skygram is an instagram clone social media app curated mainly for flight attendants. With a constant nomadic lifestyle it can be hard to maintain relationships with friends, which can get lonely. Skygram is intended to help flight attendants to make connections with people of the same lifestyle, and stay connected! Being able to create your own account, you are able to post pictures, save posts from others, follow friends, like posts and one feature that stands out from other social media apps, is the "CrashPad" feature. When flight attendants have long layovers in distantc cities, you can check the CrashPad feed to see if there are locsl flight attendants that live in that area that have a room to spare, hostel connection, or are willing to let fellow flight attendants stay in their own homes as they are away on their own trips! This creates a fun way to get to know other individuals and create friends in internaitonal cities!
